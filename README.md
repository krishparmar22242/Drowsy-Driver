# Drowsy-Driver
In an era where transportation is an integral part of our daily lives, ensuring road safety has become a critical concern. According to the reports of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) about 135,000 road accidents-related deaths occur every year in India.
In this project Drowsiness Detection System that utilizes a video or webcam for monitoring drivers without the need for complex and uncomfortable equipment. Implement a real-time video analysis system that processes each frame efficiently. This will enable the continuous monitoring of the driver's facial expressions, allowing for immediate detection of drowsiness onset. Our aim is to implement a facial feature localization algorithm that can precisely identify the location of eyes and mouth in video frames, overcoming challenges posed by varying lighting conditions and driver head movements. Employ machine learning techniques to analyze the localized facial features and detect signs of drowsiness. Train the system on a diverse dataset to enhance accuracy and adaptability to individual drivers. Design a user-friendly interface for the Drowsiness Detection System, ensuring ease of integration with existing in-car technologies. The system should provide clear alerts and warnings to the driver without causing distraction.
